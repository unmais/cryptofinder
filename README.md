# cryptofinder

A small tool that searches online crypto databases for cryptocoins. Filter criteria can be added. It's still WIP.

To be done next:

1) Code cleaning and refactoring
2) Add more filters
3) Add 'magnitude gauges' - small snippets that gauge averages and medians of certain coin magnitudes
